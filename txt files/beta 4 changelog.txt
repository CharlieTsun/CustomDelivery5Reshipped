Mangle: He'll approach out the front door, always visible. Every time he moves, he'll drop a part. Find this part and click it to pick it up. Once he reaches the front door, put on the mask to get rid of him. Note that if there are any leftover parts, this will not succeed.
Jack-O-Animatronics: When approaching the front door, there's a chance they'll show up, indicated by heavy breathing. If you open the door while they're there, you'll be jumpscared!
Ballora: She'll approach either the hallway or the kitchen entrance, shock her when she reaches the entrance. While she's in the house, your noise meter will be sensitive to movement, letting it reach peak might result in a jumpscare. When she moves, she'll also drop minireenas, the more minireenas left lying around, the more sensitive your noise meter is.
Springtrap: He'll approach out the front door, always visible. Watch out for his eye color. If they're white, then shock him once he arrives. If they're red, don't go to the front door once he arrives! Failing to do either one will result in a jumpscare.
Funtime Freddy: He'll approach the hallway like a standard animatronic. However, once shocked, BonBon will hop off in either direction, be sure to get a close look at which direction he's headed! Once you hear him charging a few seconds later, quickly make it to the appropriate entrance and shock!
Freddy Frostbear: He'll approach the front door, acting like a standard animatronic. However, if he gets inside, instead of jumpscaring you, he'll slowly freeze you in place.
8-bit Baby: When she hacks into your device, quickly find the cupcake she dropped in the house. The longer she's there, the more she'll fade in. Your screen will also pixelate. If she's there for too long, you'll be killed.
