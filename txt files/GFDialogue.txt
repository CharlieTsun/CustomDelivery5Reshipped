**GOLDEN FREDDY DIALOGUE**

- Digital Nightmare (1)-
..What are you doing here.
The agony still lies dormant..
None the matter, though
We can work still with this
There are others.
Other vessels of synergy
Awaiting your arrival
Come find me.

- Digital Nightmare (2) -
This isn't where we were supposed to meet
None the matter, though
We can work still with this
You destroyed the king
Burning most of the agony with it
....most
There are others.
Other vessels of synergy
Awaiting your arrival
Come home.

- Home Invasion -
Finally
I've been waiting to speak with you
You destroyed the king
Burning most of the agony with it
....most
There are others.
Other vessels of synergy
Awaiting your arrival
Come find me.
