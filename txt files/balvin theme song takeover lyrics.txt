Yo, yo, yo yo
We're in AR
And unlike Foxy,
who's trapped in a car
They mocked my voice,
went just a bit too far
But now look at me!
..I'm a star!

Became an icon, now known by all
A household name, cemented in gold
Aquired some aquaintances, Let's rock and roll!
Got a few spinoffs, now a theme song!

* sick guitar solo *

Stole his milk
And then became a hulk
I'll kill off all his friends
This party never ends! Yo yo yo!

Bounce around
And rap a freaking clown
I'm stuck in Ohio
I'm inside your head, you know!

Yo yo yo we're in AR
You know my reach has gone   far
Setting myself the highest bar
Cuz you know that I'm a star

Yo yo yo we're in AR
You know my reach has gone quite far
Setting myself the highest bar
Cuz you know that I'm a star

Realizing it might not be
All that true who surrounds me
Even if I don't have fame
Those who matter to me still know. my. name.

That was a joke I'm an asshole
Nowhere near sentimental
Recently went to the dental
Now bottom teeth made out of metal

Yo yo yo we're in AR. Just remember I'm a star
