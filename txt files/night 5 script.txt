Hello there, valued customer! My name is Jannifer, and I'll be your newly instructed assistence provider for the Fazbear Funtime Service! You're in luck it seems, as today we've shipped out 2 brand new exciting playmates! Springtrap is a fan favorite, known for the rumors surrounding him and the mysterious purple guy- and now, for only 999$, YOU can see him in person! (Caution, if the animatronic is seen with red eyes this means it is on battery conservation mode, it is not recommended to approach, stare directly at, or think about the animatronic during this state. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for any harm, death, or dismemberment caused by any animatronics.) Moving on, our other spectacular shipment today is Funtime Freddy, with his iconic handpuppet Bonnie! Funtime Freddy's here to show you nothing but fun fun fun! Keep an eye on Bonnie though, he enjoys playing games with you! And lastly, as a bonus, we've given you one final surprise as compensation for... the last instructor. Have a spectacular night, and I'll see YOU on the flipside!
