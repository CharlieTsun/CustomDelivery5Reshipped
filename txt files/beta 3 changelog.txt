- NEW CHARACTERS -
Chica: She'll behave similarily to Freddy and Bonnie, however, she can approach from either entrance.
Foxy: He'll behave similarily to Freddy and Bonnie, however he approaches from the front door. Unlike the others, he'll skip stages 1-4, and when he reaches stage 5 you'll hear him running towards the home yelling. You only have so long to shock him.
Toy Freddy: Sometimes he'll appear when returning to the couch. The longer he's there, the more power he'll drain, eventually killing you if power has ran out. Put on the mask as quickly as possible to avoid this.
