Chica: She'll behave similarily to Freddy and Bonnie, however, she can approach from either entrance.
Foxy: He'll behave similarily to Freddy and Bonnie, however he approaches from the front door. Unlike the others, he'll skip stages 1-4, and when he reaches stage 5 you'll hear him running towards the home yelling. You only have so long to shock him.
Toy Freddy: Sometimes he'll appear when returning to the couch. The longer he's there, the more power he'll drain, eventually killing you if power has ran out. Put on the mask as quickly as possible to avoid this.
Toy Bonnie: Sometimes he'll appear at the hallway entrance, causing your static tracker to go haywire and ignore any actual animatronics. Put on the mask to summon him in order to get rid of him, taking off the mask before he's gone will result in a jumpscare.
Toy Chica: Sometimes she'll appear at the kitchen entrance, causing your static tracker to go haywire and ignore any actual animatronics. Put on the mask to summon him in order to get rid of her, taking off the mask before she's gone will result in a jumpscare.
